Add the nat rule to the nat rulebase

    echo 'nat on tun0 inet from 192.168.1.0/24 to 10.0.0.0/8 -> (tun0) port 1024:65535 round-robin' > /home/HTB/htbnat

Use pfctl command to add the existing nat rule base:

    pfctl -sn
    ...
    pfctl -sn >> /home/HTB/nathtb

Load the new nat rulebase with this command:

    pfctl -N -f /home/HTB/htbnat
